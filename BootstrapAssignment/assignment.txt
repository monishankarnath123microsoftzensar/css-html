	1.What is meta tag and what we put inside.
	ans: Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content, the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code. Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.
	<head>
 	 <meta charset="UTF-8">
  	<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  	<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  	<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	</head>
	2. break point
	Responsive breakpoints
	Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media queries to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.
	Bootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.
	eg:	@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }
	3. while-loop & do-while loop in JS
